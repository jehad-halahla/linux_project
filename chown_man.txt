DESCRIPTION       This manual page documents the GNU version of chown. chown cha
                  nges the user and/or group ownership of each given file. If on
                  ly an owner (a user name or numeric user ID) is given, that us
                  er is made the owner of each given file, and the files' group 
                  is not changed. If the owner is followed by a colon and a grou
                  p name (or numeric group ID), with no spaces between them, the
                   group ownership of the files is changed as well. If a colon b
                  ut no group name follows the user name, that user is made the 
                  owner of the files and the group of the files is changed to th
                  at user's login group. If the colon and group are given, but t
                  he owner is omitted, only the group of the files is changed; i
                  n this case, chown performs the same function as chgrp. If onl
                  y a colon is given, or if the entire operand is empty, neither
                   the owner nor the group is changed.
