DESCRIPTION       lscpu gathers CPU architecture information from sysfs, /proc/c
                  puinfo and any applicable architecture-specific libraries (e.g
                  . librtas on Powerpc). The command output can be optimized for
                   parsing or for easy readability by humans. The information in
                  cludes, for example, the number of CPUs, threads, cores, socke
                  ts, and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes. There is also 
                  information about the CPU caches and cache sharing, family, mo
                  del, bogoMIPS, byte order, and stepping.
